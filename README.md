## 🛠️ Project Structure

* **index.html** – Main webpage that displays two dice and the game title.
* **styles.css** – Styling for the layout, typography, and color scheme.
* **index.js** – JavaScript logic to generate random dice rolls and declare the winner.
* **images/** – Contains the 6 dice images (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`).
